## Error solving process
### Find the cause

When I look at the code, '(model_file_name) .pth') must be stored in the models path via `download_file`

But the model (stage-2) is not saved


-> decided to put the model directly in the models path 

### Download the model directly
I looked for a way to download the model myself. Referenced the following site
(https://www.computerhope.com/unix/wget.htm)

> Wget <br>
On Unix-like operating systems, the wget command downloads files served with HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP over a network.

cammand: 
wget http://website.com/files/file.zip

<br>
syntax <br>
wget [option]... [URL]...

The model was downloaded via wget and checked to see if the file was in that path.


Again  `gcloud app deploy`
